	abstract = {The Chloroflexota are a phylum of bacteria containing isolates with a diversity of phenotypes, including members that are aerobic thermophiles, which use oxygen and grow well in high temperatures; anoxygenic phototrophs, which use light for photosynthesis (green non-sulfur bacteria); and anaerobic halorespirers, which uses halogenated organics (such as the toxic chlorinated ethenes and polychlorinated biphenyls) as electron acceptors.
The members of the phylum Chloroflexota are monoderms (that is, have one cell membrane with no outer membrane), but they stain mostly gram-negative. Many well-studied phyla of bacteria are diderms and stain gram-negative, whereas well-known monoderms that stain Gram-positive include Firmicutes (or Bacillota) (low G+C gram-positives), Actinomycetota (high-G+C gram-positives) and Deinococcota (gram-positive diderms with thick peptidoglycan).},

	abstract = {The phylum “Chloroflexi” contains highly divergent groups of bacteria. To understand the evolutionary relationships among these bacteria, phylogenetic trees were constructed based upon concatenated sequences for 20 conserved proteins and comparative genomic analyses were carried out to identify molecular markers (conserved signature indels or {CSIs}) that are specific for different clades of Chloroflexi. In phylogenetic trees based upon either concatenated protein sequences or the 16S {rRNA} gene, species from the class Chloroflexi and the order Chloroflexales formed strongly supported clades. The species from these clades are also clearly distinguished from other bacteria based upon 5 and 9 identified {CSIs}, respectively, in important proteins that were specific for these clades. Additionally, three {CSIs} that were specific for the genus Chloroflexus and four {CSIs} specific for the genus Roseiflexus were also identified. In phylogenetic trees, the species Oscillochloris trichoides (family Oscillochloridaceae) formed a strongly supported clade with the species from the genus Chloroflexus (and with Chloronema in the 16S {rRNA} gene tree). A specific relationship of O. trichoides to the Chloroflexus spp. is also strongly supported by 7 {CSIs} that are uniquely shared by the species from these genera but not found in Roseiflexus or any other bacteria. In addition to their phylogenetic clustering and shared presence of many novel {CSIs}, the species from the genera Chloroflexus and Oscillochloris (and also Chloronema) also differ from species of the genera Roseiflexus (and Heliothrix) by their green color, shared presence of the chlorosomes and Bchl c (in addition to Bchl a and d in some species), by their fatty acid profiles, and by the presence of β- and γ-carotenes and quinone {MK}-10. Based upon these observations, we propose division of the order Chloroflexales into two suborders: the first of these suborders Chloroflexineae subord. nov. is comprised of the family Oscillochloridaceae (emended to include the genus Chloronema) and a new family Chloroflexaceae fam. nov. consisting of the genus Chloroflexus. The second suborder Roseiflexineae subord. nov. contains a new family Roseiflexaceae fam. nov. comprised of the genera Roseiflexus and Heliothrix; orange-red bacteria lacking chlorosomes and Bchl c and differing from the Chloroflexineae in their carotenoids, quinones and fatty acid profiles. Additionally, we also provide here formal descriptions of the class Chloroflexi class. nov., and of the orders Chloroflexales ord. nov. and Herpetosiphonales ord. nov. Lastly, our phylogenetic and comparative analyses provide either no or very weak support for a grouping together of the different classes (viz. Chloroflexi, Thermomicrobia, Dehalococcoidetes, Anaerolineae, Caldilineae and Ktedonobacteria) that are currently part of the phylum Chloroflexi. However, a specific grouping of the classes Chloroflexi and Thermomicrobia (as well as ‘Thermobaculum’) is supported by both phylogenetic means and the identified {CSIs}. Based upon these results, it is suggested that the phylum Chloroflexi “sensu stricto” should be comprised only of the classes Chloroflexi and Thermomicrobia and the other four classes (viz. Dehalococcoidetes, Anaerolineae, Caldilineae and Ktedonobacteria), which are at present part of this “superphylum” should be regarded as taxa related to the phylum Chloroflexi “sensu stricto”, awaiting more detailed investigations to clarify their relationships to each other and other phyla of bacteria.},

	abstract = {The phylum Chloroflexota (formerly Chloroflexi) encompasses metabolically diverse bacteria that often have high prevalence in terrestrial and aquatic habitats, some even with biotechnological application. However, there is substantial disagreement in public databases which lineage should be considered a member of the phylum and at what taxonomic level. Here, we addressed these issues through extensive phylogenomic analyses. The analyses were based on a collection of {\textgreater}5000 Chloroflexota genomes and metagenome-assembled genomes ({MAGs}) from public databases, novel environmental sites, as well as newly generated {MAGs} from publicly available sequence reads via an improved binning approach incorporating covariance information. Based on calculated relative evolutionary divergence, we propose that Candidatus Dormibacterota should be listed as a class (i.e., Ca. Dormibacteria) within Chloroflexota together with the classes Anaerolineae, Chloroflexia, Dehalococcoidia, Ktedonobacteria, Ca. Limnocylindria, Thermomicrobia, and two other classes containing only uncultured members. All other Chloroflexota lineages previously listed at the class rank appear to be rather orders or families in the Anaerolineae and Dehalococcoidia, which contain the vast majority of genomes and exhibited the strongest phylogenetic radiation within the phylum. Furthermore, the study suggests that a common ecophysiological capability of members of the phylum is to successfully cope with low energy fluxes.},
